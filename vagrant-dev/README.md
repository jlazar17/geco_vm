# Vagrant Dev Folder

Use the `Vagrantfile` in this folder to develop modifications to both:

 1. The provisioning script used to create the `stefco/geco-vm` virtual box
 2. The Vagrantfile in the main directory that is used as a minimal template
    to get new users started with `stefco/geco-vm`

You don't need to worry about the stuff in here if you are only interested
in using `geco-vm`.
